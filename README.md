## ?? What is Moltzer?

Moltzer is a **native desktop application** that connects to your Clawdbot Gateway, providing a fast, beautiful interface for chatting with Claude and other AI models. Unlike browser-based or Electron apps, Moltzer uses your operating system's native webview, resulting in:

- **~10MB binary** (not 300MB like Electron!)
- **Minimal RAM usage** (~50MB vs 500MB)
- **Native look & feel** on every platform
- **Secure credential storage** via OS keychain

Think of it as "ChatGPT for Clawdbot" � but better, because it's yours.

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** "Cannot connect to Gateway" error

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Gateway is running:**
   ```bash
   clawdbot gateway status
   ```
2. **Check Gateway URL:**
   - Default: `ws://localhost:18789`
   - If using HTTPS, try `wss://` instead of `ws://`
3. **Check firewall:**
   - Ensure port 18789 is not blocked
   - Add exception for Moltzer and clawdbot

**Problem:** Connection drops frequently

**Solutions:**
1. Check network stability
2. Increase timeout in Gateway config
3. Use `wss://` for more reliable connections

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** App feels slow or laggy

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear local database:**
   - Settings ? Advanced ? Clear Cache
   - Warning: This deletes all conversations
2. **Check resource usage:**
   - Open Task Manager/Activity Monitor
   - If using >500MB RAM, file a bug report
3. **Update to latest version:**
   - Check [Releases](https://github.com/AlixHQ/moltzer-community/releases)

### Encryption Issues

**Problem:** "Cannot decrypt conversation" error

**Solutions:**
1. **Master key may have changed:**
   - Check OS keychain/credential manager
   - If key is missing, conversations cannot be recovered
2. **Fresh start:**
   - Export important conversations first
   - Settings ? Advanced ? Reset Encryption Keys

### Platform-Specific Issues

**macOS:**
- **App won't open:** Right-click ? Open (to bypass Gatekeeper)
- **Frozen UI:** Update to latest version (known issue on macOS 13)

**Windows:**
- **SmartScreen warning:** Click "More info" ? "Run anyway"
- **WebView2 missing:** Download from [Microsoft](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)

**Linux:**
- **AppImage won't run:** `chmod +x Moltzer-*.AppImage`
- **Missing dependencies:** Install `webkit2gtk` and `libayatana-appindicator3`

### Data & Storage

**Problem:** Conversations disappeared

**Solutions:**
1. **Check if database is intact:**
   - Developer Tools (F12) ? Application ? IndexedDB ? MoltDB
2. **Check encryption keys:**
   - Settings ? Security ? Verify Master Key
3. **Restore from backup** (if you have one):
   - Settings ? Import/Export ? Import Backup

**Problem:** App uses too much disk space

**Solutions:**
1. **Delete old conversations:**
   - Conversations are stored locally forever by default
2. **Clear search index:**
   - Settings ? Advanced ? Rebuild Search Index

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Check logs:**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Moltzer/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Moltzer\logs\`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/Moltzer/logs/`

2. **Report a bug:**
   - [Open an issue](https://github.com/AlixHQ/moltzer-community/issues/new/choose)
   - Include: OS version, Moltzer version, error messages, logs
